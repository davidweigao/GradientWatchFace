# GradientWatchFace

Under development, need to clean the code, need to create more configuration options

This is an experimental project that I created when learning Android Watchface design. The watchface drawing function is made as a separate module so that both App and wear app can use it to draw the watchface. 

In the app module, there are two simple activities to make watchface configuration. One is for color, and another is for style. 

The watch drawing process is divided into two steps. 
1. draw the background
2. draw the time 
So that they can be drawn in different style. 

The main watch functionality is based on Android sample watchface project.
